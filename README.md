## About the Challenge

Please take a look on the [challenge layout](https://share.goabstract.com/6dadeb1d-f205-49b7-af8c-f0bc2652a242).</br>
You will find everything you need on `/assets` folder.

You will be building a React web app based on the Next.js framework.
To learn a bit more about the stack:

- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)

The goal is to build a checkout process within a single page application that includes 3 pages and with some steps in between:

- Product list and selection page
- Checkout page
  - Shipping details form
- Success page

### Product list and selection page

- Present a list of up to 5 products. To create such products you can use [faker.js](https://rawgit.com/Marak/faker.js/master/examples/browser/index.html#commerce) or other tool
- The user should be able to select a single one of those products
- After selecting the product, at least one product variant should be presented (e.g. quantity, size, color, etc.)
- The user should be able to add the selected product and variant
- A summary section should be shown with the final price the user will pay

### Checkout page

- The checkout page must be a different route
- It should have a summary section with all products in cart and total price
- Present a form for the shipping details with the following fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Address
  - Postal code
  - Country
  - Phone
- All form fields must be filled in order to complete a successful purchase
- The user should be able to save the selected shipping details
- Add a button to complete the order that routes to a success page - no need to actually fake a purchase

### Success page

- The success page must be a different route
- Present a success message showing the order has been completed
- List all products purchased, the shipping details and total price paid

## Acceptance criteria (must have)

- Use of React and Next.js
- Does it run as expected: Does the step-by-step required to run the application work?
- Code organization: Module separation and project organization
- Documentation of your process:
  - Instructions on how to run the project (e.g. README.md, DEVELOPERLOG.md)
  - What was done
  - What could be improved
- Pages must be fully responsive and mobile friendly
- Unit tests - no need to achieve 100% coverage, but rather cover some components to showcase your test writing skills
- Good markup, semantic HTML and SEO concerns

## Optional criteria (nice to have)

- Use of CSS-in-JS
- Use of TypeScript
- Use of [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org)
- Loading transitions between pages (e.g. [react-loading-skeleton](https://github.com/dvtng/react-loading-skeleton))
- Accessibility concerns
- A demo website running on Vercel, Netlify or any other similar free platform
- It doesn't have to be pixel perfect but follow the layout
- Use theme with design tokens
- Use a internationalization framework (e.g. [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/))
